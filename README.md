# Welcome to Remix + Vite!

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) for details on supported features.

## Typegen

Generate types for your Cloudflare bindings in `wrangler.toml`:

```sh
bun run typegen
```

You will need to rerun typegen whenever you make changes to `wrangler.toml`.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```sh
bun run dev
```

To run Wrangler:

```sh
bun run build
bun run start
```

## Deployment

> [!WARNING]  
> Cloudflare does _not_ use `wrangler.toml` to configure deployment bindings.
> You **MUST** [configure deployment bindings manually in the Cloudflare dashboard][bindings].

First, build your app for production:

```sh
bun run build
```

Then, deploy your app to Cloudflare Pages:

```sh
bun run deploy
```
